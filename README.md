My ~/.emacs.d Configuration
========================
I was originally a Vim user before switching to Emacs. I still use Vim on and off but I am now spending the majority of my time in Emacs. Because of my previous Vim usage, I have all of the Vim bindings ingrained in my muscle memory. This Emacs configuration is my attempt to mimic the best parts of my previous Vim setup. Long live modal editors!

# Setup

The setup is simple and automatic.

1. Install: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnm/emacs.d/master/install | sh`
2. Run emacs!

You might run into some errors during emacs initial boot up... just close and start emacs until there are no more installation errors. 

## Disclaimer

This configuration is very much tailored to my workflow so go forth with caution.
