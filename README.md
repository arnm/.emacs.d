My ~/.emacs.d Configuration
========================
I was originally a Vim user before switching to Emacs. I still use Vim on and off but I am now spending the majority of my time in Emacs. Because of my previous Vim usage, I have all of the Vim bindings ingrained in my muscle memory. This Emacs configuration is my attempt to mimic the best parts of my previous Vim setup. Long live modal editors!

# Setup

The setup is simple and automatic.

1. Use the install script: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/arnm/emacs.d/master/install | sh`
2. Run emacs!
